Algorithms==========A collection of algorithms. Each algorithm serves mostly to demonstrate a concept and help me understand it better. This repository is mostly for keeping track of my study, but hopefully it can be useful to someone else too. :)## AboutI have taken different courses about algorithms, but I have never collected my notes in single place - leading to troubles when preparing for an interview. This is why I decided to start this repository.## Courses & Sources- hackerrank.com- codefights.com- FMI Course- Algorithms: Design and Analysis @ Stanford Coursera- 6.00x @ MITx## Contents- [Data Structures](/DataStructures)- Techniques  - Backtracking    - [Staircase](/Techniques/Backtracking/starcase.py)    - [nQueens](/Techniques/Backtracking/n_queens.py)    - [Sum Subsets/Sublists](/Techniques/Backtracking/SumSubsets/)  - Dynamic programming    - [Staircase](/Techniques/DynamicProgramming/starcase.py)    - [Robbery](/Techniques/DynamicProgramming/house_robbery.py)
